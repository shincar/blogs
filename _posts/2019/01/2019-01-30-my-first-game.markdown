Here is my first game - [Click Game][click-game].

Actually it's not a game. It's just a prototype of game that use ProcessJS to create a board and let user to click on the grid. It's a course project when I learned in [Khan Academy][khan-academy]. Now I just finished the course and thought it would be a good idea to use github pages to host a website with my kid. We could learn together and I could guide him to the world of programming sometimes.
